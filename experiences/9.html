                      <br><br> Some days before, I was feeling like nothing new is happening in my life and all I am going through is the monotony. I feared to tell it to anyone in my family as they would blame my mobile as the only reason behind it all. I was living in a dark world without any hope for a light. I felt that no one cared for me, I am stupid, worthless, no one wants to talk to me.
                      <br><br> All these thoughts consequently made me feel miserable, I thought all my dreams have shattered. Watching other people having all this quarantine fun and sharing it on their status, I felt that how will I face them, they all are gaining some good skills and all I am doing is this overuse of mobile watching youtube and web and can't have an explanation for where my time goes. I used to open my phone, start youtube and watch whatever is there in the feed and all, just like a helpless person who couldn't say what he or she wants to watch. I started feeling that I am not worth living this life and wanted to give up. The thought that life after death would be a silent sleep and this whole mess in mind would get a full stop. So I started searching the way which would minimise the pain and help me get out of all this. My family didn't know anything about this all as I prentended to be normal to them. They thought that this all is laziness and nothing which is stopping me to do any activity or be cheerful. I hated to meet anyone be it my friends or my relatives and when they asked me, I used to refuse under the pretext of social distancing.
                      <br><br> Amid all this, one evening I started talking with an old friend of mind, she advised me to take a break from everything and just feel my own self. She forced me again and again to speak up everything I was feeling. It was not so easy to tell what you are going through everytime. But she motivated me a lot and her positive vibes helped me to summon the courage and speak up. She had undergone many psychotherapeutic sessions, so she knew it all. She could effectively empathise with me. She asked me to getup early and go for a walk. She forced me to do yoga and meditation. It was difficult, but she was there as my helping hand. Then it is the same day, Sunday on which I was finding a painless way to end up and now when I look back, I feel thankful to her that she helped me and saved me. She thought that I am facing monotony, but actually I was at the starting phase of "Anhedonia" i.e. the lack of pleasure which I came to know after an online therapy from a psychiatrist.

                      <br><br> Please stay in touch with you dear ones. Talk to them and let them know that they are not alone, you are with them. Bring them out of their lonliness.
                       <br><br> Love
                       <br> Morpho
