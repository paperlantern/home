          <br>


          Everyone has problems in their families and so have I.
<br><br>Born and brought up in a normal middle class family, I never knew about the role of a father until I joined my first school. On the very first day of my school, seeing other children coming with thier daddies to school, children crying to their parents not to leave them alone, there was this little girl who had come all way to school by a van and not with her dad or mom! She felt like something is wrong with her or the others. In lunch time, my friends used to talk about their happy families and so did I(but their families included stories of their papas but not mine).
<br><br>Carrying all your baggage by yourself from school to college is a little weird, but now it doesn't make me sad anymore afterall mummy has managed to do all the things on her own without the help of dad and so should we!
<br><br>My dad is a drunkard, he has a habit of drinking to that extent where he spends all his earnings on himself only( that is on those liquor shops). He would be beating us after drinking if maa tolerated it all, but she is the most strong lady I have ever seen. Just like a tigress, she saved her children from all this drama. As it is always said, "to every problem there is a solution." My grandfather was an angel. He has alway taught us to face every problem in life and just do our karma, the rest he said is upto the god. He has always considered us to be a brave son and we were apple of his eyes. He knew that after his passing, our family situation would become worse, so he managed to buy some properties in the name of our mom and our entire living is now dependent on the rent from those shops. I was in third standard when my grandpa passed away. Everything was shattered then. Daily yellings and cries, managing every little thing be it the household works or going to tehsil or Vegetable market, maa had to play the role of a father and mother both and still she plays it. We fear not to do anything which will bring unnecessary burden on her shoulders. Being sick is one of worst things for all of us as we have to manage all on our own, going to clinic or buy medicines.
<br><br>And dad, he lives in his own utopian world, as if he is just a tenant. Sometimes he helps us too when he is not drunk. He lives upstairs because we shifted all his things there so that even if a plumber comes to repair something, he doesn't know anything about this man otherwise he will take advantage of the situation and not do repair properly. Dad starts drinking in the morning with the vegetable sellers and then abuses us. Maa stops him yelling at him and asks him to go upstairs. Imagine waking up and listening to screams and cries and shouts, this makes me feel bad but now I am used to it, this scene has become a daily part of my life now and I can do nothing about it. All I do is put my earplugs and play loud music, even if it will make me deaf it would be far better than listening to this daily fight.
<br><br>We have learned to do and face everything on our own and will continue to do so be it shifting to a whole new place or taking admission in the college. Life has been so unfair to us, for every little thing, life makes suffer a lot. Sometimes when I see others with their fathers taking care of every single need, I feel like cursing ths God that why has he been so unfair with us! But then I think about the sacrifices mom has made for us and I feel blessed to be born to a tigress.
To everyone out there reading this, life may seem unfair many times, but we cannot do anything about it except fighting.

<br><br>P.S. I don't have a really bad father and I don't want any sympathies over it. Just wanted to share to let everyone know that each one of us is fighting our own battle and we are not alone in it. Life is equally unfair to all of us...
