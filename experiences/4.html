                      So it all started in 2015 ,when I went to kota for entrance preparation,things were smooth ,sab sahi tha shuru main pr aage ka raasta literally bohot zaada kharab tha,8 ghante padhte padhte kb padhai se hi ji uth gya pta hi nhi chala ,being a good student in school it was so bad for me to see my bad grades in review tests so as were for my family,the ultimate end day came and I flunked badly in JEE.
                      <br><br>I was lost , I wasn't seeing anything positive ,the optimism was lost, I myself was lost,also I gave my 12 board exams from jhalawar for which I used to board a bus in early 4A.M.,so as expected I took a drop,but I was too scared to go back to kota,I just prepared again from the scratch for the entrances, gaining optimism and yet again I lost ,badly,I just lost hope, don't want to meet anyone,just lying on my bad,the sleep won't just come, nothing has been this much bad just nothing ,maybe I was depressed, I don't know,I still remember that dark time ,I just used to think how I wasted my parents money for three yrs and just could not get anything.One day I cried ,my parents were seeing and I was weeping ,I was emotionally devasted tbh.
                      <br><br>Then my father came to me,he said all you have seen is bad time give upsee with full strength ,it won't even matter to me if you lose again, what would matter would be that you tried again.Gaining momentum, I gave upsee and here I'm, atleast in a government college doing engineering , making roast videos, making singing videos, someone asked me one day why you make these videos , actually the biggest reason is to make people smile,life is not a straight lane with garlands, it's an emotional script,you gotta give your best performance, leaving the movie won't get you an award,but doing a performance would definitely give. Suicide is just never an option, life is much more what we think, just keep yourself busy, just keep doing and you'll achieve what you want, even if you don't, you atleast tried, Remember my favorite lines"ruk jaana nahi tu kabhi haar ke ,kaaton se chalke milenge saae bahaar ke".
                      <br> <br>Regards
                      <br>Pushkar
