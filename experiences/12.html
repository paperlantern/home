          What's a perfect family? We all have problems in our families..no one could have a perfect family. But is it fine to tell yourself every other day that it's fine, there are problems in every family. Today is holi and I am sitting here, crying and then someone in my family would say tomorrow or any other day, 'it's fine.. everyone has problems in families'. Until when?

<br><br>  We love each other..when everything's fine..I feel its the best family but  but every festival every special occasion doesn't goes in peace..it's getting heavy day by day. And the worst part is, I can't share this with anyone,I fear judgement..and they won't understand this too.

<br><br>  It starts with my parents..they don't have a healthy relationship between them and the affect is on me and my family. Anger, shouting is the only thing I have seen from childhood, it has affected me in the worst possible way. Even if there would have been one issue, it would have been fine.. financial instability, trust issues, saying anything out of anger. For a large part of my life, I have never complained to anyone in the family about anything..I always fear it would result in a fight and now I am not able to express my feelings to anyone. People would never know this as nobody knows me that much they have always seen my brighter side, even my friends don't know anything about my this.

<br><br>  I want to leave them, it would be easy atleast I could live in peace. I was in hostel and atleast then I was fine but since the last one year, it's worsening day by day.

<br><br>  I know there is no solution for this atleast I know I am strong enough to go through this until I am with them...just wanted to share.
