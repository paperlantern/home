          Hii there,

<br><br>          I do not like sharing things much, especially the bad ones. I don’t like being pitied for what I have been through and all. But I will do it today.
<br><br>Due to some reasons, I was not with my parents for a greater part of my childhood. In my family’s opinion, it was for my good and they believed it strongly. Strongly enough to send their 5-year-old son away. I used to live with some people, distant relatives of some sort. They did not actually want me to be with them but they kept me as a return for some favor it seemed. As for me, it felt as if nobody, not even my parents wanted me. Although their motives were good to me it seemed very cruel.
<br><br>All my classmates used to talk about how they enjoyed last day playing with dad and how they ate the delicacies their mom made for them. As for me, I had nothing to say as I would sit complete evening crying and just counting days waiting for the summer break. Cause that was when I went home. Things were fine till then but time had many things stored. As people around me started to know about my whereabouts it became a common thing in the school corridor “The unwanted boy”. Yes, I have much moderated the actual wordings. It all started affecting me as I was quite young. With all this going the people I lived with were also not what you would call kind. They took me as a burden and they proved it too. For them all I meant was another mouth to feed. My mind started to believe that I was useless and no one actually needed or even wanted me. And with literally no one to console my little mind, that belief grew stronger and stronger. In a way I started losing myself.
<br><br>It was later when I was 14, I had to come back home for the people I used to live with got to move to some place where I would have to face a great deal of problems in continuing my education. Well although it felt like a relief for a moment from all that mental torture. But the damage was already done. I have siblings and when I returned, they were quite young about 4 and 5 and they found me as an outsider asking me when was I going to leave? Things just got worsening as I did not feel that connection that one feels with his family. All though my parents now pitied me but I was beyond repair now, as I thought then. But well one needs to continue living but its how one does that matters. I remained silent for most of my day while a never-ending debate on my existence continued in my brain. At this point people started approaching me to be with me and talk with me but I seem to repel them away with my gloom and agony. I believed that nothing good could happen ever in my life and I just had to survive till my last breath comes.
<br><br>I did not want anyone to advise me or even help me because I felt this was all and there could be nothing more to it. But god has mysterious ways of saving people. For me it was a friend I still cherish to have. He did not advise me neither did he make me feel as if he was helping me but he made me realize that I still had lot to accomplish and lot to be proved. It was his actions which made me rethink about my own existence. It may seem very odd but things as simple as smiling while you meet someone and treating them as normal and no different from you even though you know they are. Helps them a great deal. It was not the problems which I faced but the alienation that bothered me the most.
Now I am doing much better with that friend and many more with me now.
<br><br>I feel I had overcome the worst and strive toward the best. The thing is this change did not come overnight but it took years to accept my reality but I took a step at a time and each step I took made my belief stronger and stronger. The thing which I found is life is not easy for anyone the difference is it is unfair in different ways. As for me the biggest change was, “Nothing good could happen to me…to…all bad that happens can be tackled if you are willing to enjoy all that is given to you”.
<br><br>That was my story of how I lost and found myself back. Thank you if you read till the end.
<br><br> - Lost in the dark
