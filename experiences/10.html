          Hii there,

          <br> Well this is the most most personal thing, that I could share with anyone. It's the story of which is no less than some bollywood script consisting of love, fight, emotions,drama except that in the end I got to learn the lesson , and
          took the most important and hardest decision of my life . I am sharing this so that it could help someone and everyone could learn something from my experience.
          <br>I used to love a boy from bottom of my heart. He was everything to me . My day never ended without him . I used to fight with my family members to talk to him. Many time I was beated up by my parents , but nothing in the world would
          stop me to be with him at the end of the day. I never wanted anything else except him . We talked , laughed ,fought ,helped each other regularly. It had been three long years since we were together , and I was sure that I will be spending
          my entire lifetime with him .
          <br>I couldn't imagine anything without him . I was so desperate for him that I would do anything to talk to him . I trusted him blindfoldedly , and used to do anything to make him happy ,let it be making 50 pages love card , or avoiding my
          studies so that he could feel better.
          <br>But there's a quote that Happy life is an illusion. Real life is ultimately filled with with suffering, and tragedy that ends in death and grief. I was living my life on illusions , that yes there is someone who could never hurt me
          whatsoever happen. He will never change ,he will just be mine and tons of other fairy tale beliefs ,too far away from the real world.
          <br><br>But the moment came which changed everything . He suddenly changed. He started dominating me over few things , and many a times he made me cry over few little things. I was bearing all the pains happily just because I loved him . He
          made me cut my hand and write sorry for mistakes which I haven't even done and I happily did those stuff. At the same time my family was forcing me to maintain a distance from him , and it was for my betterment only , but I was so mad that
          I kept on fighting with them ,used to talk him secretly and many a time was scolded and warned by my parents and friends too, but still that affected me little , afterall I was bearing all the pain for someone I loved.
          <br><br>This continued for over 7-8 months , I beared everything happily for us ,and those were the most terrible days of my life . I slept many nights empty stomach as I didn't fell hungry , passed many days lying around an empty room
          doing nothing just crying for him, bearing pain for him and overthinking .
          <br><br>Due to this type of behavior he started taking me for granted that no matter what I will be there for him , never leave him ,and he could do whatever he wants ,,and he was right too . I was that type of despo at that time ,, I
          couldn't see anyone ahead of him .
          But when life hits you ,it hits you very hard and you ought to leave all your bad habits at that point , that moment teaches you the best lessons of your life. That happened with me too.
          <br><br>After bearing all the pain for 7-8 months , one day he abused me countinously for hours thinking that I will still tolerate , thinking that I was still that weaker version of myself , thinking that I love him so I will bear
          everything. But this time my inner self was shouting ,that something has to be done now.
          <br><br>It was the time to get over my comfort zone and take the most important decision till I had ever made . After bearing so much of pain for someone it was not a cakewalk to take that decision , but still I had to take that decision
          for my self respect .
          <br><br>I boldly took the decision of leaving him , which was not easy at all , because I have been dreaming of spending my entire life with him .
          <br><br>Still it's very hard for me to move on ,,but whatever I did was for my self respect. I would like to say this to every girl ,,that always remember , that nothing is more important than your self respect ,,and you have to be tough
          enough to take the decision when it's time to do so. And one thing more I would like to say that you should know your limits in a relationship; how much you should do for somebody ; and what is that thin line between true love and taking
          someone for granted or in other words using someone for our needs!
          <br><br>Yours truly,
          <br>Santripti VermaðŸŒ¼ðŸŒ¸
