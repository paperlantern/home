                      Well it all starts after class 12th , when first time I saw the face of real world , outside the boundaries of my beloved school life. It was the time to choose the career , when first time in life I felt that what the mess had I created. Everyone was taking admission in different colleges and I was still not sure what to do. And when you don't know your path clearly , everyone else in this world try to be your master. That was the case with me too.. 55 students out of 60 in my class chose btech. I was probably thinking , what's wrong with them ,,how could they all wanted to do the same thing. At that point I decided that what so ever happens ,I am not going to be part of this rat race. <br><br>

                      I was never open to my father. I was scared to talk to him about my wish, my choices and so on. And whatsoever he decided for me ,I used to follow that blindly. But this time it was not easy for me at all. My father wanted me to do engineering ,and I hated that. <br><br>

                      I passed many sleepless nights , the world was almost ending to me. You know there's always a hope of some light from somewhere , when you are surrounded with darkness from all side. In my case it was my uncle . He talked me openly about my choices and wishes , and finally made me understand that, sometimes you need to see the world with different angle. Although engineering is overrated these days ,but it's not the case that you need to do this only in your 4 yrs ,it will give you opportunity to explore ,to do whatsoever you want to do in your life . Finally I took a drop year ,and reached BIET JHANSI. MY FRIENDS I HAVE GOT 2 THINGS TO SHARE WITH YOU: <br>1. Never think yourself as alone. You just need to find the right person to help you. <br>2. Always try to see your problems as an opportunity to improve yourself ,to make your self best. <br><br>
                      Regards <br>
                      Ashi
