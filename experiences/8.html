                      <br>


                      <br>Is is true that the world will adjust with you? Really not so. Why do I feel worse watching some movie and then realizing my loneliness? Why I can't find a single being to stand by my side? Why I find only darkness to be there for me? Is it all just a negativity or the monotony I am facing?
                      <br><br> Having been grown up in a middle class family, all I have been told is to get a good job and earn for family. To get settled and get married.
                      <br><br>What about my dreams?
                      <br><br>What if I chose to marry someone whom I have had spent some days of my life? What will my family react when they get to know I want to marry someone not from my caste but from some high or low caste? Will they leave me forever if they get to know I want to marry someone not from my religion or caste?
                      <br><br>Thinking of their reactions and the then situation just brings a hell in my mind. I just avoid thinking about this all. I don't have someone not because I am worthless, but because everytime my feelings are bound by my responsibilities.
                      <br><br>To be a good person to be an ideal human, is it necessary to avoid your innerself? Why life is so unjustified? Why people don't value emotions?  Everytime I supress my feelings for a person, I just kill my own self. I feel like being a machine driven by other's opinions and values. And I am not complaining with my family. What they do and think for me is justified. This world is so cruel to value our emotions. When you hold a hand, you cannot be so sure it will remain there always. The world follows the rule "move on". But why? Is moving on so easy for someone who has given their 100 percent loyalty? Moving on is just a sign that you are too variable with people and with yourself that you can't just keep that one person close to yourself. You can't prove your loyalty and you don't feel any shame upon that. You are a free bird to have anything with anyone. The other person is a mere idiot to suppose you to be their everything. This cruelty just horrifies me to hold a hand forever.
