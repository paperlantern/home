                  <h3>

                      <br>


                      



                      <br>It's pride month. You can't be proud of yourself for just one month. But that one month is sufficient to exhibit that you love yourself and are in no mood to yield to social pressures. You are not going to be in a closet anymore. 

                      <br><br>For centuries, the social structure and societal norms have subducted those whose bodies, gender identities and sexual inclinations didn't fit in. In many countries, homosexuality is still a sin, transphobia is still a thing, being intersex is still a matter of shame. 
This is when LGBTQ+ relinquishes the shadows. And today when we argue the importance of sex education, it is apparent that soon lesbians, gays, transgenders and other would find a mention in school books.
   
<br><br>      <strong>Leaning on Meaning</strong> 
<br><br>What does LGBTQIA+ stands for? 
<br><br>Let's read about each term. 
<br><br>L stands for Lesbian. Lesbian is any woman who is romantically or sexually attracted towards another woman. 

<br><br>G represents Gay. Gay is any man who is romantically or sexually attracted towards another man. 
Lesbians and Gays are basically the 'Homosexuals'. 

<br><br>B stands for Bisexual. It can be a person of any gender and is romantically or sexually attracted to same as well as opposite gender. 
Sometimes a bisexual person may be romantically attracted to one, and sexually to the other gender. 

<br><br>T stands for Transgender. Transgender are people whose gender identity is different from the gender they were assigned at birth. A transgender man lives as a man today but was identified as female at birth. 

<br><br>Q stands for Queer. Queer is a word that describes sexual and gender identities other than straight and cisgender. It is an umbrella term for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and others. Queer is also used to express that someone might not be sure of their sexual and gender identity or may not fit into any prevailing categories. 

<br><br>Next comes I, Intersex. Intersex people are individuals born with any or several variations in sex characteristics including chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones or genitals that do not fit the typical definitions for male or female bodies. 

<br><br>A represent Asexual. Generally, an Asexual person experiences little or no sexual attraction towards any gender. But they can be romantically, aesthetically or emotionally attracted towards a person. 

<br><br>What does the '+' stands for.  when it comes to gender and sexuality, there can be various combinations of bodies, identities and sexualities. + stands for various other terms that people may fit in, like pansexual, allosexual, Bicurious, Demisexual and some more. 

<br><br>Wait, Transgender or Intersex?
<br>We are still confused when it comes to the identification of a person as transgender or intersex. And 'we' here does not refer to just the common people; the confusion and misinterpretation manifest in the high position and authorities. 

<br><br>The Supreme court's 2014 ruling and transgender's rights bill, passed by Lok sabha - both describe Intersex people as a type of transgender person. 

<br><br>Talking about the 'Hijra' community. Most of them are transgender who renounce their male identity; this community also includes intersex persons. 

<br><br>The Number says- 
<br>There are no official demographics for LGBT+ population. According to what government of India submitted to the Supreme Court in 2012, there are 2.5 million homosexual and 4.8 million transgender people in India. Other findings reveal there are 2% Indians who identify as other than male or female. 9% identity as bisexual, 1% as pansexual and 2% as asexual. 
<br>Research finds intersex people to constitute an estimated 1.7% of the population. It is evident that the LGBTQIA+ community constitute a significant part of our population.
