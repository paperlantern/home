                      <br>
                      <br><br>Gender dysphoria is a situation where a person feels extremely uncomfortable with their gender and feels a strong desire to belong to the other gender. Although all transgender people do not face gender dysphoria, the condition is common enough that gender reassignment surgeries exist.
                      <br><br>Gender Reassignment Surgeries (GRS) are surgical procedures that change the sexual characteristics of a trans person to that of their identified gender. 
                      <br><br>Following these procedures, the patient may even have to opt for lifelong hormone replacement therapy.
                      <br><br>Even the GRS itself isn’t risk-free. Patients may face bleeding, infections, poor healing of incisions, nerve injuries, injuries to the urinary tract, etc.
                      <br><br>Despite all these risks, in the year 2019, around 11,000 people opted for GRS in the USA alone. 
                      <br><br>So basically, the trans people of the world feel so alienated from the rest of us that they would rather face surgery to change their bodies than simply exist like the rest of us. 
                      <br><br>And if you think about it, society has given its contribution to this alienation pretty generously.
                      <br><br>When was the last time you saw a trans person being given the same respect that we all feel obligated to have?
                      <br><br>All over the world, terms like Trans and Gay are used as insults. In India, “Hijra” is one of those terms.
                      <br><br>In fact, the entire LGBTQ+ community has faced rather dehumanizing behavior in the modern era.
                      <br><br>Interestingly enough, Ancient Greeks have demonstrated that accommodating LGBTQ+ relationships isn’t really that big of a deal. They openly accepted these relationships, and Bisexuality was extremely common.
                      <br><br>But for some reason, we, the modern people who have learned a great deal about Human Rights and care so much about the equal treatment of all humans can’t even overcome the prejudices we offer on the basis of uncommon gender identities.
