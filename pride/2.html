                      In 2019, Brunei shook the world with its new anti-LGBT Laws with provisions of ‘death by stoning’ to men engaging in homosexual acts. United Nations echoed the statement, said the legislation is, “cruel, inhumane and degrading” and that it was a ‘serious setback’ to human rights. After boycott and backlash on a global level, the order was revoked. But that did not end violence and discrimination against the LGBT community, either in Brunei or around the world.
                      <br><br>Homosexuality remains criminalised in 76 countries with countries like Afghanistan, Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Somalia, Nigeria and UAE having provisions for death penalty. India took a revolutionary step in September 2018, when the Supreme Court scrapped the provisions of 377 of Indian Penal code which criminalised Homosexuality in India for more than a century. The transgender persons (protection of rights act 2019) seeks to recognize transgender persons and prohibits discrimination.
                      <br><br>After a long battle for identity and security, 2 GBT persons still stand on crossroads where every route is destined to new tussles and challenges. 
                      <br><br>Naomi and Kentina of New Jersey narrate the bias they faced when a wedding planner cancelled working with them as they were a lesbian couple, and their marriage stands illegal according to bible. 
                      <br><br>A survey by Swasti Health Resource Centre indicates 52% of Gay men in India without a peer support suffer violence. Violence begins at home. According to queer activist Rituparna Bora, “families are a huge trouble spot. We grow up learning only one type of family- a hetero-patriarchal family. There is no demonstration of different types of families. Domestic violence cases go highly unreported. A 54 year old in Delhi raped his 16 year old daughter to prove ‘ sex was better with men’, when the girl revealed she was a lesbian. This is not the only incident. Several lesbian women are sexually harassed and given the name of ‘corrective rape’.
                      <br><br> Violent hate crimes against LGBT people tend to be brutal, compared to other hate crimes. They frequently involve torture, cutting, mutilation. Conversion and Correction therapies still exist, involving electric shocks to homosexuals and transgender, claiming to ‘cure’ them. The cases of violence do not seem to reduce ever after the decriminalisation of same-sex relationships. A 23 year old boy Sanjit Mondal of Narayanpuram recalls the harrowing incident when he was forcibly taken to Narayanpuram Police Station, and beaten and labelled ‘gay’ for his long hair and earrings. He was also forced to accept his involvement in prostitution.
                      <br><br> Nearly 70% of the bullied LGBT students in India face anxiety and depression. Around 1/3rd of the LGBT students discontinue school due to physical bullying. 43% of LGBTQ students surveyed- between ages 18-20- faced sexual harassment in primary school.
                      <br><br> In April 2018, a teenage student in Gopalapuram, Chennai revealed in social media that he has a female crush. Soon, the girl was teased, ridiculed and the teachers verbally abused the girl; even calling her a prostitute. The Principal asked her to “go and kill herself.” This is when discrimination, bullying and ragging targeted at a student on the grounds of the sexual orientation or gender identity is prohibited under the UGC Regulation on curbing the Menace of Ragging in Higher Educational Institution(3rd Amendment) 2016.
                      <br><br>“It became hard for me because everyone made fun of me, they didn’t sit with me, and they didn’t even touch me as if I had sanctions made me sit separately. I felt troubled both at home and in school, so I decided to stop school”, describes a transgender student how insensitivity and ignorance leads to numerous school drops.
                      <br><br>According to the census, 54,854 transgender children are now between the ages of 10 and 16 and should currently be in schools. But, agonizingly, there were inly 19 transgender students in class 12 and 6 in class 10 who appeared for board exams.
                      
                      <br><br>Formulating laws is highly insufficient in protecting the rights of LGBT community. It requires a will, a resolve to re-establish humanity and sensitivity, by authorities and people. Sex education has to be made an integral part of school curriculum to have a better sensitised and more aware upcoming generation.
