                  <h3>

                      <br>
                                            
                      <br> <br>"I have the right and the freedom to identify and to live as I choose." 
                      <br> <br>The Supreme Court stated that no one will be coerced to undergo any sex and gender-based insane treatment. 
                      <br> <br>Homosexuality is not a sin. Don't know when people will understand this, till then how many innocent people will lose their precious lives. Parents who stand with their children in every situation also torture their own children if they are homosexuals. Why do we forget the fact that sexual orientation doesn't come by itself? 
                      <br> <br>Knowing that Conversion Therapies are unscientific or invalid practices to change an individual's sexual course from homosexual or bisexual to heterosexual (sexual relationship between a man and a woman) by using physical or spiritual interference. The practitioner has no proof that sexual course can be changed but the renowned medical organizations always stated that these therapies are completely inefficacious and detrimental. In May 2020, the terrible hanging of Anjana Harish, a 21-year-old bisexual woman in Goa, kindled online protests. She had posted a video online before her suicide describing how she had been subjugated to conversion therapy by her family in her home state of Kerala. Her death reinvigorated endeavors by protesters to call for a complete ban on the practice. 
                      <br> <br>It is not a standalone case as several people having bisexual issues suffered this. Despite seeing all this horrifying, it is being practiced by many cosmic menders and doctors. 
                      <br> <br>As we all know that, the felonious method of 'Conversion Therapy' is used against LGBTQ+ people in India. 
                      <br> <br>Three techniques used in the practice of “conversion therapy”. 
                      <br> <br> <strong>PSYCHOTHERAPY</strong>
                      <br> <br>A method used is aversion (electric shocks, nausea-inducing or paralysis-inducing drugs) through which a person is subjected to a depressing sensation while being exposed to a certain 
                      <br> <br>stimulus connected to their sexual orientation. 
                      <br> <br> <strong>MEDICAL</strong> 
                      <br> <br>It counts on pharmaceutical methods, such as medication or hormone, or steroid therapy. 
                      <br> <br> <strong>FAITH-BASED</strong> 
                      <br> <br>People are usually submitted to the doctrine of a spiritual counselor and subjugated to programmes to defeat their “condition”. 
                      <br> <br>It consists of anti-gay slurs and beatings, shackling and food deprivation. They are also sometimes combined with exorcism.
