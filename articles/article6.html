                  <h3 class="article">

                    <br> "Such an amazing term ""SELF WORTH"". But what does it mean? What are its implications? Why is it important? What is the worth of ""SELF WORTH"" itself?

                    <br><br>In general or what we call NORMAL life self worth is a sub-conscious thing which runs along with us. It is there when we make a decision , help somebody or even eat some thing. Always it reminds us that we are special and we have a purpose to fulfill. It helps us to feel happiness. Yes, happiness is always related to self worth. Don't believe me?

                    <br><br>When do we feel happy. Most frequent is when we achieve something we worked hard for. When someone shows affection towards us. When we help someone and many more. All these somewhere give us a feeling that I am something and I can be something more than this too. This is what is self worth. It drives you to achieve greatness. It acts as a fuel for life. Unfortunately every fuel exhausts sometimes and needs to be refilled.

                    <br><br>The problem comes when we face failures. Maybe in an exam , a relationship , being ignored by someone we cared deeply. Anything that gives you the feeling that I am not worth it. I am a looser or breaks you from within eats up your self worth. Fuel that filled you with life drains in all these situations. Sometimes it drains slow while others it just vanishes. So what do you do when your car runs out of fuel? Do you leave it on the road and burn it. A big NO! , Right. You search for fuel and get your car back on track.

                    <br><br>So why do people tend to loose hope when they loose their self worth? Actually its not that simple as refilling your car. It takes a lot of courage and dedication to search for self worth. But once you gather that courage to start the search you will find it just in front of you. Maybe a passing butterfly can fill you up with joy and cheer. You never know when and where life will take turns but what you always should know is,

                    <br><br>""Tomorrow is always gonna be different.""

                    <br><br>Maybe it feels quite a bit unreal when you are totally devastated and broke but you know what, when you think you are alone and no one is out there for you. Thats the time when you are closest to yourself.

                    <br><br>Always remind yourself what all you have achieved and how you plan to do more. Tell yourself how you have some excellent people who love you maybe less in number but they are enough for you. Tell yourself how great and happy your future is going to be. All this helps a lot in building your self worth.

                    <br><br>You might have heard the saying..""Health is wealth"" .I got my own saying..,

                    <br><br>"" I am the greatest wealth I could ever have.""

                    <br><br>Hope this was of some help for you.ðŸ˜Œ
