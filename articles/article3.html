              <section class="article_content">

                  <h3 class="article">

                    <br>Yes you read it right. Being what you really are can never be normal. Seriously, what is being normal? Is it studying hard in school or is it to have a lot of friends and partying all night. Is it having loving parents or having no parents at all. Is it living in a 2 storey house or living on the footpath by the road...
                    Can we actually decide on what actually being NORMAL is!!
                    <br>You see a begger eating from used plates and you go like yakkk! This is so abnormal for you, but for him this is what his life has been even since he learned to walk or saw the sun for the first time and that is totally normal for him.
                    On the other hand when you visit some really expensive place which even maybe once in a lifetime experience for you. You find some people whom you call millionaires walking around as if it was just another day! You feel overwhelmed and at the same time small. Or we could say it feels awkward to you but it is really normal for them.
                    I think it is evidently clear by now that "NORMAL" is not a generalised term. It is totally differnt for different people.

                    <br><br>Usually when a child is born,the first thing he does is finds a family. May it be beggar,buisnessman or thief. Who so ever the baby sees first becomes the family. Here he first defines the term normal. What all things the family does seems normal to him. Later he grows and meets people from different families with different definitions of 'NORMAL' and here is the point when he starts questioning his definition of NORMAL. He finds it obligatory to change to others definition of NORMAL to mix with them and thus leaves his own definition behind. He stops being who he really was and pretends to have accepted the other definition although deep inside he knows that this is not what NORMAL feels like . BUT curbs his feelings and goes with the flow. Maybe this is what is right, he thinks. With every passing day he losses a part of his soul and finally becomes a machine governed by a definition devised by someone else.

                    <br><br>WHY? Why can't we all be normal in our own way?
                    <br>Why do we need to be normal in a particular way?
                    <br>I can do nothing but imagine a world where everyone has his own definition of normal. Everyone weird in their own special way. Everyone happy in whatever way they like to be. Sure it would be weird for everyone but atleast it would be normal to youüòÅ.A place where everyone is normal for themselves and weird for others.

                    <br><br>"Being you is not normal...
                    <br>Being you is really weird...
                    <br>Understand it or be normal for the rest of your lives."‚úå
