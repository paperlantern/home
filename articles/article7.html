              <section class="article_content">

                  <h3 class="article">

                    <br><br> The clock strikes 3. It's time for results. The entire country is hooked to their cell phones. Toppers are being congratulated, interviewed by several news channels and sweets are being stuffed in their mouths.
                    <br><br> There's another set of students who couldn't qualify. Family, relatives and friends, suddenly all turn into motivational speakers. They are given examples of great leaders who failed in their initial stages.
                    <br><br>The third batch is of the students who exist, but are still invisible to friends, family, relatives and media. They are 'The Average Students'. They work hard day and night. Harder even than the toppers but they never bag a spot in the leaderboard. They follow rigorous schedules, give their life and blood to their studies but the harvested crop is always smaller than expected. The percentage marks are always lesser than expected. No one congratulates them for working so hard and getting a decent result. No media channel wants to interview them. Their names and photographs are not published in the next day's papers.
                    <br><br>Toppers are taken away at once by colleges. The one's who fail contemplate on what they want in life. But no one cares to ask the 'Average' how they feel. They are like the bricks used in foundation of a huge sky scraper, who always remain below the ground in the dark. No one cares when they are made to feel inferior and other classmates as kings and queens with a difference of just a few marks. Are marks everything? Is'nt there a life beyond academics where the 'Average' might be a topper, and topper an average?
                    <br><br>I had always been one of the toppers of my school. I would'nt deny that all the attention toppers get is hard earned. But the wheel of time rotates. I suffered from OCD and depression. But just then, when my performance in academics began to drop, I experienced what is to be an average student. What it is to be a student who is never on thr 'Shining Star' page of their school magazine.
                    <br><br>I also got to see a life beyond marks. A life where all that matters is life. Where you are the number one in your own special way.
                  <br>  <br>Next time you congratulate a topper, remember there is someone who worked really hard and didn't finish #1
