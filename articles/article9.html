    <h1 class="article-head"> <strong>Suicide: A Loss of hope</strong> </h1>
    <section class="article_content">

      <h3 class="article">


        <br><br> This society needs a rethink and is culpable if losses around fearless self-expression, creative pursuits, individualistic mind journeys and diverse social relationships are all opposed for a singular narrative.

        <br><br>Isn’t it strange that our society extends compassion and empathy on the one hand, but discriminates, bullies and segregates on the other? According to the World Health Organization 8,00,000 people die due to suicide every year. Many of us may ignore the value, but in reality, it means that 1 person in every 40
        seconds give up their lives which is the second leading cause of deaths in the world. Talking about our nation, there is 1 suicide every four minutes in India.

        <br><br>No matter whether the suicide was impulsive or well planned, one thing is for certain: no one attempts to end their lives unless they have lost hope for their future. Though the feelings of hopelessness are universal, suicide is also
        preventable.

        <br><br>Depression and suicide are interlinked. Why suicide happens? The person committing suicide has lost the hope to live, not because of their weakness but due to the fact of our so called society's stigmas. "You are not feeling well, you
        are overthinking, take life as it is and don't complain, life is what you make it, you are negative thinker and so you are sad, be positive, all you want is attention " and a number of such sentences they tell you instead of asking you how do
        you feel or making you feel that its okay not to be okay. Life has given them everything served in a plate and so they lack empathy towards others thinking and bitching that people suffering from mental health are comics, they make life a
        burden to them etc. Depression is not sadness just like fever is not only increase in temperature. So the next time you give your useless advice to others and claim their negativity, remember one thing, "negativity doesn't brings them
        depression, but the depression brings in negativity."
        <br><br>If you can't help, just stay quiet and be empathetic rather than blaming people for their illness.
       Perhaps, introspection and humility could guide us through a collective soul-searching exercise. Let’s think twice before we treat anyone who doesn’t fit into a
        well-packaged treasure, in ways that meet our expectations and approval, as marginal.
