                      Friends ,the world around us is changing with much greater pace than we could imagine. And some or many of the times we are not able to cope up with the this changing world. Many a times we feel like we are left behind. The sheer pressure of achievements, responsibilities, ambitions, dreams ,goals, expectations and so on has huge impact on us. Some of us are able to cope up with all these stuff, but many of us feel stuck to some point or other. It happens with almost everyone.<br><br>
                      So what's the solution to this , should we start crying to all our problems . You also know that the answer is absolutely no. Friends we all have got only one life, so why we should waste it crying for all the problems that we all have in our life. Don't you think we have got this life, to do something greater than that, to be a reason of smile on someone's face, to make this earth a beautiful place where, no one has to suffer with the problems that you are suffering. Everyday is an opportunity for you to have a fresh start, so just have a belief that you are born to do something great. You are a gift to the humanity from the great lord.
                      <br><br> And whenever you feel like you are at the end, and will not be able to handle more, just remember, that there is someone who still cares for you, who still hopes for you to achieve everything.
                      <br><br>Regards
                      <br>Ashi
